matplotlib can be considered both the benchmark and the workhorse when it comes
to data visualization in Python. It is tightly integrated with NumPy and the basic func‚Äê
tionality is easily and conveniently accessed. However, on the other hand, matplotlib
is a rather mighty library with a somewhat complex API. This makes it impossible to
give a broader overview of all the capabilities of matplotlib in this chapter.
This chapter introduces the basic functions of matplotlib for 2D and 3D plotting useful
in most financial contexts. Other chapters provide further examples of how to use this
fundamental library for visualization.
